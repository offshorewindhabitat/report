If the score values were normally distributed (like a bell curve) around the average, then one standard deviation (SD) above/below is about 34.1% higher/lower than the average (so 68.2% of all values), two SDs is 47.7% higher/lower than the average (so 95.4% of all values) and three SDs are the most extreme at 49.9% higher/lower (so 99.9% of all values).\n\nWashington/OregonNorthern CaliforniaCentral CaliforniaSouthern CaliforniaWestern Gulf of MexicoCentral Gulf of MexicoSouth AtlanticMid AtlanticNorth Atlantic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure C.1: Interactive map of standard deviations from the average score in the zone.
