    "text": "Development of offshore wind energy will be essential for providing renewable energy to mitigate climate change impacts, yet needs to be sited responsibly to avoid sensitive habitats. Acoustic impacts from construction and operation may negatively impact some species (Mooney, Andersson, and Stanley 2022). Hard substrate provided by the platforms may actually benefit other species (Wilson and Elliott 2009). Wind energy areas are under active development by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) throughout the United States. This study will assess habitats for sensitivity throughout strategic parts of the US.\nA couple fundamental questions driving this analysis are:\n\nHow different are existing lease areas from the rest of the region? (intra-region)\nAreas not already slated for the offshore wind leasing impact species and habitats less, so could be candidates for alternative future planning. Areas with designated military use and outside BOEM’s authority (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries) need to be further excluded from consideration.\nHow different are existing lease areas from each other within a given region?

    "text": "2.1 Spatial Hierarchy: Regions > Zones > Blocks\nDetermination of regions for which to assess offshore habitat was based on BOEM activity and representativeness of habitats across the continental United States (Figure 2.1). The first (and presently only commercially in production) US wind farm at Block Island, NJ is in the North Atlantic where $4.4 billion was paid in offshore wind bids earlier this year (DOE news). The Atlantic seaboard slopes gradually making it appropriate for fixed platforms, whereas the Pacific coast drops off quickly into deeper depths making floating platforms more suitable. These technological differences therefore affect the bottom habitats differently. Whereas fixed platforms involve pile driving and addition of additional hard surfaces for habitats, the floating platforms leave only the benthic footprint of moorings and submarine cables.\n\n2.1.1 Regions and Zones\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Regions (Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific) are subdivied into Zones corresponding to BOEM Planning Areas in federal waters clipped to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (except Alaska and Hawaii).

(intra-region)\nAreas not already slated for the offshore wind leasing impact species and habitats less, so could be candidates for alternative future planning. Areas with designated military use and outside BOEM’s authority (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries) need to be further excluded from consideration.\nHow different are existing lease areas from each other within a given region? (inter-lease)\nWithin the leasing process the most oversight can be exercised within existing lease areas, especially ones in the earlier stages of Proposed Sale Notices and Call Areas. Identifying less impacted lease areas may lend greater stakeholder support for development.\nBenthic habitats will be the focus of input data, predominantly available through the Marine Cadastre (Table 1), especially based on seafloor properties (e.g., rock, grain size, rugosity), the presence of habitat forming species (e.g, coral, seagrasses, kelp) and other species. Species data will also be assessed from the AquaMaps distribution and OBIS observations.\n\n2.3.1 Processing Steps\n\n\n\n\nDownload dataset\nAs raster or vector\nConvert dataset layers to common raster format\nIn order to calculate quickly across a wide range of spatial data based on different formats (vector or raster), spatial units of analysis and projections, a common study area and grid was generated from the GEBCO elevation map and projected to Web Mercator for readily displaying in “slippy” maps online. The area-based distortion of Web Mercator was compensated for by calculating the true area per cell as a separate multiplicative layer for use in calculations.\nAverage within dataset-species layers\nSome datasets include seasonally (e.g., [du]) or regionally (e.g., [nc]) distinct density surfaces. These get averaged (for seasonal) and mosaicked (for regional) together to produce a single average per dataset and species.\nRescale dataset-species layers 0 to 100% for all model types\nWhile this analysis is detailed spatially, it is coarse in terms of abundance, since the best available spatial distribution information is combined across disparate dataset types, i.e. expert range maps (i.e., [rl]), probability of occurrence (i.e., [am]) and density surface models (e.g., [du], [sw], [nc], [gm]). Model values were rescaled 0 to 100%, i.e. normalized to the existing probability of occurrence range of values (i.e., [am]). For instance, the original maximum density surface model value for common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Atlantic from [du] is 286 individuals per km2, whereas for the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Pacific from [sw] is 0.00491 individuals per km2. Both of these maxima are converted to 100, since we are not comparing relative abundance between species but rather within species. Since expert range maps are binary in nature, i.e. in or out of range, a single value of 50% is applied within the range. Converting the stored values to single unsigned integers (INT1U for the range [0, 100]) enables a significant reduction of individual raster file sizes. Furthermore zeros were converted to NA (not available) for the sake of calculating the species range.\nMosaic to single taxa across datasets, taxa\nApply weights\nextinction risk, endemism, trophic level,.…\nSummarize with equation\n\nExtract across spatial hierarchies\nStudy, Regions, Zones, Blocks\nMake scores relative to spatial hierarchy"
