The normalized form of the database should not require repeating the geometry for each polygon to reproduce the original dataset that may be shared across values for an individual model as well as across multiple models. If models in the dataset use more than one collection of polygons, then the polygon group ply_grp field is optionally used to differentiate which set of polygons to use.\nAll features are projected to the geographic (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system for leaflet R package visualization of polygons with “slippy” basemaps (e.g. “Esri.OceanBasemap” at Leaflet Providers).\n\ndatasets\n<ds_key>, ...\ncells_ds_ply (cells to dataset polygons)\n<ds_key, ply_id, cell_id>\nds_{ds_key} (dataset model attributes)\n<ds_key, mdl_id>, aphia_id, fld_ply_val, val_type, ...\nds_{ds_key}_plys (dataset polygon attributes, including values)\n<ds_key, ply_id>, val = {fc_flds}, ...\n\n\n\nA.1.4 Models Based on Rasters\nAll rasters are projected to web Mercator (EPSG:3857) coordinate reference system for leaflet R package visualization of rasters with “slippy” basemaps (e.g. “Esri.OceanBasemap” at Leaflet Providers). Since the variable is usually continuous, new values may be interpolated to the web Mercator raster with method = \"bilinear\" option (versus method = \"nearest\"). Because of this, the value is directly stored in the _cells_rast table for all raster models (versus a lookup of OffHab cell_ids to the original raster’s pixel).\n\ndatasets <ds_key>, …\nds_cells_rast (cells to dataset pixel values)\n<ds_key, mdl_id, cell_id>, val\nmdls_{ds_key} (dataset model attributes)\n<ds_key, mdl_id>, aphia_id, val_type, ...\n\n\n\nA.1.5 Future Development\n\nAdd columns to handle relationships between models, such as uncertainty (e.g. sd/cv/ ci95pct / ci5pct; not using yet) associated with which density:\n\n{mdl_key}_mdls.: mdl_related | mdl_relationship\n\nAdd value transformation column (val_transform) to {mdl_key}_mdls to standardize values from original to val_type (not using yet since all relative so far):\n\noa_mdls.val_transform: \\(val^3\\)\ndu_mdls.val_transform \\(val/100\\)"
