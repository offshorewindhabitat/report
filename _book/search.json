    "text": "2.1 Spatial Hierarchy: Regions > Zones > Blocks\nDetermination of regions for which to assess offshore habitat was based on BOEM activity and representativeness of habitats across the continental United States (Figure 2.1). The first (and presently only commercially in production) US wind farm at Block Island, NJ is in the North Atlantic where $4.4 billion was paid in offshore wind bids earlier this year (DOE news). The Atlantic seaboard slopes gradually making it appropriate for fixed platforms, whereas the Pacific coast drops off quickly into deeper depths making floating platforms more suitable. These technological differences therefore affect the bottom habitats differently. Whereas fixed platforms involve pile driving and addition of additional hard surfaces for habitats, the floating platforms leave only the benthic footprint of moorings and submarine cables.\n\n2.1.1 Regions and Zones\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Regions (Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific) are subdivied into Zones corresponding to BOEM Planning Areas in federal waters clipped to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (except Alaska and Hawaii).

    "text": "2.3 Analysis\nA couple fundamental questions driving this analysis are: How different are existing lease areas from the rest of the region? (intra-region)\nAreas not already slated for the offshore wind leasing impact species and habitats less, so could be candidates for alternative future planning. Areas with designated military use and outside BOEM’s authority (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries) need to be further excluded from consideration.\nHow different are existing lease areas from each other within a given region? (inter-lease)\nWithin the leasing process the most oversight can be exercised within existing lease areas, especially ones in the earlier stages of Proposed Sale Notices and Call Areas. Identifying less impacted lease areas may lend greater stakeholder support for development.\nBenthic habitats will be the focus of input data, predominantly available through the Marine Cadastre (Table 1), especially based on seafloor properties (e.g., rock, grain size, rugosity), the presence of habitat forming species (e.g, coral, seagrasses, kelp) and other species. Species data will also be assessed from the AquaMaps distribution and OBIS observations."

The normalized form of the database should not require repeating the geometry for each polygon to reproduce the original dataset that may be shared across values for an individual model as well as across multiple models. If models in the dataset use more than one collection of polygons, then the polygon group ply_grp field is optionally used to differentiate which set of polygons to use.\nAll features are projected to the geographic (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system for leaflet R package visualization of polygons with “slippy” basemaps (e.g. “Esri.OceanBasemap” at Leaflet Providers).\n\ndatasets\n<ds_key>, ...\ncells_ds_ply (cells to dataset polygons)\n<ds_key, ply_id, cell_id>\nds_{ds_key} (dataset model attributes)\n<ds_key, mdl_id>, aphia_id, fld_ply_val, val_type, ...\nds_{ds_key}_plys (dataset polygon attributes, including values)\n<ds_key, ply_id>, val = {fc_flds}, ...\n\n\n\nA.1.4 Models Based on Rasters\nAll rasters are projected to web Mercator (EPSG:3857) coordinate reference system for leaflet R package visualization of rasters with “slippy” basemaps (e.g. “Esri.OceanBasemap” at Leaflet Providers). Since the variable is usually continuous, new values may be interpolated to the web Mercator raster with method = \"bilinear\" option (versus method = \"nearest\"). Because of this, the value is directly stored in the _cells_rast table for all raster models (versus a lookup of OffHab cell_ids to the original raster’s pixel).\n\ndatasets <ds_key>, …\nds_cells_rast (cells to dataset pixel values)\n<ds_key, mdl_id, cell_id>, val\nmdls_{ds_key} (dataset model attributes)\n<ds_key, mdl_id>, aphia_id, val_type, ...\n\n\n\nA.1.5 Future Development\n\nAdd columns to handle relationships between models, such as uncertainty (e.g. sd/cv/ ci95pct / ci5pct; not using yet) associated with which density:\n\n{mdl_key}_mdls.: mdl_related | mdl_relationship\n\nAdd value transformation column (val_transform) to {mdl_key}_mdls to standardize values from original to val_type (not using yet since all relative so far):\n\noa_mdls.val_transform: \\(val^3\\)\ndu_mdls.val_transform \\(val/100\\)"
