    "text": "Development of offshore wind energy will be essential for providing renewable energy to mitigate climate change impacts, yet should be responsibly sited to minimize impacts on sensitive species and habitats. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the federal offshore leasing of wind energy for the United States (U.S.) and has defined regions, zones and individual lease blocks, which were used to evaluate differences in species and habitats for the federal waters of the U.S. lower 48 states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). In order to combine species distribution models (SDMs) from varying sources, they needed to be harmonized according to: 1) a common taxonomy, using the AphiaID from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) at MarineSpecies.org; 2) a common geography, using the most refined available global bathymetric raster, the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) at GEBCO.net; and 3) a common response term. The harmonized response term rescaled input SDMs 0 to 100 according to a preferred hierarchy of available models for the same species: 1) density surface models, where the original response was # individuals / km2 for 151 species of marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles across 4 datasets; 2) habitat probability models, which had a continuous response of 0 to 1 for 9,639 species from AquaMaps.org; and 3) expert range maps with a binary response of 0 or 1 for 342 species from the IUCN Red List. From the combined SDMs, species richness and species abundance were calculated per pixel along with an aggregate extinction risk for those species having an IUCN Red List category assigned. An overall conservation score also incorporated primary productivity, hydrothermal vents and seamounts with equal weighting for each layer. These scores were calculated on a per pixel basis as well as aggregated to zone and region levels. At the block level, the standard deviation from the zone’s mean score was calculated to differentiate and rank blocks."

    "text": "Development of offshore wind energy will be essential for providing renewable energy to mitigate climate change impacts, yet should be responsibly sited to minimize impacts on sensitive species and habitats. Acoustic impacts from construction and operation may negatively impact some species (Mooney, Andersson, and Stanley 2022). Hard substrate provided by the platforms may actually benefit other species (Wilson and Elliott 2009). Although only 42 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy capacity is operational (in Rhode Island and New York) as of May 31 2022, the pipeline of potential generating capacity is estimated to be 40 gigawatts (GW) – enough to power 13 million homes (Musial et al. 2022).\nWind energy areas are under active development by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) throughout the United States. This report assesses habitats for sensitivity throughout the federal waters of the U.S. lower 48 states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii).\nA couple fundamental questions driving this analysis are:\n\nHow different are zones (and regions)? (inter-zone/region)\nAreas not already slated for the offshore wind leasing impact species and habitats less, so could be candidates for alternative future planning. Areas with designated military use and outside BOEM’s authority (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries) need to be further excluded from consideration.\nHow different are blocks from each other within a given region? (inter-block, intra-zone)\nWithin the leasing process the most oversight can be exercised within existing lease areas, especially ones in the earlier stages of Proposed Sale Notices and Call Areas. Identifying less impacted lease areas may lend greater stakeholder support for development.\n\nWhile density surfaces are most preferable, especially for determining number of individuals impacted by human activity (e.g., for Potential Biological Removal as mandated by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Roman et al. 2013)), the distributions of relatively few taxa have been described by these model types. The most comprehensive atlas of marine species distributions comes from the AquaMaps (Kaschner et al. 2019), which uses only 4 terms per environmental predictor (min, max and preferred min and max) to produce a gradient of habitat suitability (Ready et al. 2010). Yet another type of distributional information is based on a binary range map, such as produced by taxonomic experts with the IUCN RedList process.\nCollating the best available data has been a significant challenge to date and has become all the more important with the global push for 30% conservation protection of land and sea by 2030 with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework resolution passed at the Convention of Biological Diversity meeting in Montreal in December, 2022 (Findlay 2023). Although the U.S. was notably absent from the 190 signatory countries, President Biden has advocated for similar protections nationally through the “America the Beautiful” initiative. The lack of comprehensive biodiversity information has been noted (Carroll, Noss, and Stein 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nCarroll, C., R. F. Noss, and Bruce A.

    "text": "3.1 Spatial Hierarchy: Regions &gt; Zones &gt; Blocks\nDetermination of regions for which to assess offshore habitat was based on BOEM activity and representativeness of habitats across the continental United States (Figure 3.1). The first (and presently only commercially in production) US wind farm at Block Island, NJ is in the North Atlantic where $4.4 billion was paid in offshore wind bids earlier this year (DOE news). The Atlantic seaboard slopes gradually making it appropriate for fixed platforms, whereas the Pacific coast drops off quickly into deeper depths making floating platforms more suitable. These technological differences therefore affect the bottom habitats differently. Whereas fixed platforms involve pile driving and addition of hard surfaces for habitats, the floating platforms leave only the benthic footprint of moorings and submarine cables.\n\n3.1.1 Regions and Zones\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Regions (Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific) are subdivided into Zones corresponding to BOEM Planning Areas in federal waters clipped to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (except Alaska and Hawaii).

    "section": "3.3 Processing Steps",
    "text": "3.3 Processing Steps\n\nDownload datasets\nDatasets were downloaded from their online sources and chosen based on availability throughout the EEZ of one or more of the U.S. regions (i.e., Pacific, Gulf of Mexico and/or Atlantic).\nConvert dataset layers to common raster format\nIn order to calculate quickly across a wide range of spatial data based on different formats (vector or raster), spatial units of analysis and projections, a common study area and grid was generated from the GEBCO bathymetric grid at 15 arc second spatial resolution and projected to Web Mercator for readily displaying in “slippy” maps online to easily show basemaps of interest (e.g. the Esri Ocean basemap). The area-based distortion of Web Mercator was compensated for by calculating the true area per cell as a separate layer for deriving the area-weighted average in the output cells. All data layers were downscaled to a common grid of approximately 15 arc-seconds (each pixel ranging in area  0.16 to 0.31 km2) aligned with the GEBCO high resolution global bathymetry in order to calculate differences between individual lease blocks (ranging in area 0.022 to 276.186 km2).\nAverage within dataset-species layers\nSome datasets include seasonally (e.g., “Duke Atlantic Marine Mammal Densities) or regionally (e.g.,”NCCOS Atlantic & Pacific Seabird Densities”) distinct density surfaces. These get averaged (for seasonal) and mosaicked (for regional) together to produce a single average per dataset and species.\nRescale dataset-species layers 0 to 100% for all model types\nWhile this analysis is detailed spatially, it is coarse in terms of abundance, since the best available spatial distribution information is combined across disparate dataset types (see Table 3.2), i.e. expert range maps (i.e., “IUCN Global RedList Ranges”), probability of occurrence (i.e., “AquaMaps Global Probabilities”) and density surface models (e.g., “Duke Atlantic Marine Mammal Densities”, “SWFSC Pacific Cetacean Densities”, “NCCOS Atlantic & Pacific Seabird Densities”, “NOAA GoMex Cetacean & Sea Turtle Densities”). Model values were rescaled 0 to 100%, i.e. normalized to the existing probability of occurrence range of values, similar to the dataset “AquaMaps Global Probabilities”. For instance, the original maximum density surface model value for common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Atlantic from “Duke Atlantic Marine Mammal Densities” is 286 individuals per km2, whereas for the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Pacific from “SWFSC Pacific Cetacean Densities” is 0.00491 individuals per km2. Both of these maxima are converted to 100, since we are not comparing relative abundance between species but rather within species. Since expert range maps are binary in nature, i.e. in or out of range, a single value of 50% is applied within the range. Converting the stored values to single unsigned integers (INT1U for the range [0, 100]) enables a significant reduction of individual raster file sizes. Furthermore zeros were converted to NA (not available) for the sake of calculating the species range. A similar hierarchy was taken for “Biologically Important Areas to Cetaceans” in the US (LaBrecque et al. 2015).\n\n\nMosaic to single taxa across datasets, taxa\nSince some datasets were not present in all regions, a mosaic approach was taken whereby different datasets could contribute to different regions, based on which had the most preferred data type (density &gt; probability &gt; range &gt; occurrence) and most recently collected (newer &gt; older). Of 10,061 species, only 41 had multiple datasets contributing to different regions.\nAggregate layers to use as inputs to scoring\nSpecies Richness was calculated as the sum of the presence of taxa in a given pixel. Species Abundance was the sum of the normalized abundance (ranging 1 to 100) within the pixel across all species. Extinction Risk was based on the sum of all species IUCN RedList Categories for the given pixel, based on conversion of the categories to a score: 0 for Least Concern (LC), 1 for Near Threatened (NT), 2 for Vulnerable (VU), 3 for Endangered (EN) and 4 for Critically endangered (CR) [Juslén et al. (2016);butchartImprovementsRedList2007].\nScore with input layers\nCalculate the score per pixel with the input aggregate layers using Equation 3.1.\nExtract across spatial hierarchies\nAverage zonal statistics were then captured across the full spatial hierarchy of Study, Regions, Zones and Blocks.\nNormalize Block scores\nIn order to easily compare Blocks within a Zone, pixel and Block scores were subtracted from the Zone mean and divided by the standard deviation (Equation 3.2). This way pixels and Blocks equal to the mean will be 0, positive values containing higher conservation scores, negative values lower conservation scores."

    "text": "This report represents a major step forward in collating disperate datasets to inform on the biodiversity of offshore habitats for US wind energy development. Although other efforts have combined AquaMaps and the RedList range maps (Halpern et al. 2012; O’Hara et al. 2017), this work represents the first attempt to combine these datasets with higher resolution density surface models.\nAlthough the latitudinal gradient in species richness going from high to low in a poleward direction has been well described (Rabosky et al. 2018), the order of magnitude difference in species richness between the Atlantic (698.6 species per pixel) and the other regions of Gulf of Mexico (38.9) or Pacific (15.5) is noticably stark. Given that the Pacific is a western-boundary current with upwelling, it is cooler and more productive than the other regions associated with warmer waters like the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Atlantic.\nThe NOAA bottom trawl surveys represent one of the most authoritative, fishery-independent survey data for the United States demersal fish. These data were recently used for evaluating wind energy areas in the Northeast (Friedland et al. 2021) and species range shifts from climate change (Pinsky et al. 2013; Pinsky et al. 2021; Maureaud et al. 2021). NOAA recently transferred the interpolated biomass maps of species quantified from Pinsky’s OceanAdapt portal into the NOAA Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (DisMap). Using the same inverse-distance-weighting interpolation techniques we generated similar maps of species biomass, except for the BOEM planning regions. However, the spatial extent of these results do not span far enough offshore to encompass the full BOEM planning areas with expansive gaps in between. Ideally in future these data can be used to statistically model with environmental predictors predictions across the seascape, similar to Friedland et al. (2021).\nWe hope this effort to collate the best available species distribution models into biodiversity metrics of conservation interest into the future. NOAA and NASA have invested in the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MarineBON.org), which would be a sensible lead organization for atlas stewardship. Towards this end a Biodiversity Indicators working group is actively meeting to assess datasets and methods for combinatorial approaches for presenting this information towards satisfying the “America the Beautiful” initiative nationally and the “30 by 30” (30% conservation by 2030) effort globally.\n\n\n\n\nFriedland, Kevin D., Elizabeth T.
